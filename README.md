# edoexpenses
An MVC application to create, edit and list expenses.

## Synopsis
This web application was created as an exercise to test my knowledge in AngularJS and Spring boot. By no means is a final product. It uses an in-memory h2 database in the backend.


## Running the application
To run the application, place yourself in the directory where you downloaded the project and execute:
```
./gradlew bootRun
```

After succesful spring boot loading, go to your internet browser and access the page:
```
http://localhost:8080
```

Feel free to play with the application at your own will, as the data is saved in memory and will be reset every time you restart the application.
